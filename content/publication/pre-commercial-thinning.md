Silvicultural tools such as green retention harvesting and
multiple variations of partial cut systems are being developed to implement
ecosystem-based forest management. However, very little effort has been expended
in developing silvicultural treatments for young stands. Results for a selective
precommercial thinning (three thinning intensities and control) covering a
28-year period in a balsam fir-dominated stand are presented. Thinning did not
significantly increase stand yield, nor change stand diameter diversity or
distribution. Furthermore, diameter distributions and diversity of dead stems
also did not differ significantly (P > 0.05) among thinning intensity. More
important than intensity effects, statistical differences were found between
initial stand densities. Low initial densities had greater yields and more
diverse diameter distributions. Nevertheless, for low initial stand densities,
light to moderate thinning seemed to increase yield, whereas moderate to heavy
thinnings would be appropriate for high initial stand densities. Although
selective precommercial thinning does not result in significant changes in stand
structure, it could be used as a first step in increasing stand complexity
within the context of ecosystem-based management.
