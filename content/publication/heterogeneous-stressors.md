Mathematical models together with empirical tests suggest that it may be
possible to detect leading indicators, or early warnings, of approaching shifts
in ecosystems. Previous studies have often relied on ecological systems where
the stressor (e.g. temperature, precipitation) is assumed to act homogeneously
in space. Many ecological systems are, however, prone to spatially heterogeneous
stresses (or ‘spatial stressors’), such as grazing, whose strength vary as a
function of local vegetation patchiness. Here, we employed three well-studied
spatially explicit ecological models to investigate how spatial stressors
influence (a) the dynamics and resilience of ecosystems and (b) the robustness
of early warnings of approaching ecosystem shifts. Mean-field and numerical
simulations of the models suggested that spatial stressors could affect the
stability and the number of equilibria of the system. Trends of spatial and
temporal indicators were broadly consistent with the theory, i.e. they exhibited
increasing trends as the system approached ecosystem shifts. However, in two of
the three models, at high levels of spatial stress, spatial indicators could
either exhibit trends opposite to those expected by the theory, or show no
signals at all. Our results suggest that spatial stressors can interfere with
the spatial patterns and thereby with the theoretically expected trends of early
warning signals of ecosystem shifts. This highlights, once again, the importance
of having a good knowledge of the ecosystem under study to be able to accurately
interpret the indicator trends observed.
