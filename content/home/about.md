# About

My research interests span all aspects of community ecology, with an emphasis on
plant community and biotic interactions. I investigate the modulation of species
interactions according to environment and the effects of species interactions on
the properties of community and ecosystems. I try to develop both theoretical
and empirical approaches and I believe that consequent conceptual advances in
Ecology come from the close integration of those two approaches.
