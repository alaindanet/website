# About

My research interests span all aspects of community ecology, with an emphasis on
plant community and biotic interactions. I am currently developing several
research topics namely (i) the modulation of species interactions according to
stress and disturbance, (ii) the integration of positive interactions in
ecological theory, (iii) the effects of species interactions on the properties
of communities and ecosystems such as their stability. I believe that consequent 
conceptual advances in Ecology come from the close integration between
mechanistic models and empirical observations, so I develop both theoretical and
empirical approaches.
